# Virtual assistant made from scratch just to learn Python
The idea is to make a virtual assistant that doesnt need to recieve voice commands.

It detects when my Mi Band is near by throught bluetooth and notify me about new emails, events in the calendar.

It can also interpret commands, differenciating between verbs and nouns, just to be able to interpret the same order said with different words and to give it the ability to interpret different parameters for the same command.

### Features
    - Check email and notify them
    - Check for events on Google calendar and notify when needed
    - Add events to Google calendar (not finished)
    - Make a backup to external drive
    - Open file explorer on specific path
    - Open terminal on specific path
    - In the evening, suggest an alarm for the next day dependiong on events in calendar (not finished)
    - Play Spotify music and control volume
    - Run specific app
    - Check whenever Mi Band is close by Bluetooth scanning to notify new events, making a buffer of notifications not notified yet.
