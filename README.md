# Virtual assistant made from scratch just to learn Python
The idea is to make a virtual assistant that doesnt need to recieve voice commands.

It detects when my Mi Band is near by throught bluetooth and notify me about new emails, events in the calendar.

It can also interpret commands, differenciating between verbs and nouns, just to be able to interpret the same order said with different words and to give it the ability to interpret different parameters for the same command.
